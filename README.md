# AoC2020

Contains my solutions to the AoC2020 puzzles. 
Most puzzles were completed on the day of release in Python, with the exception of days 19 and 20. Code has not yet been tidied up - you have been warned.

I am now in the process of writing solutions in C++ that will (hopefully) run a little faster.

General summary of the Python solutions is below:

## Day 1: Report Repair
### Part 1:
An easy intro to my first AoC problem. The naive bruteforce solution was sufficient so that was all that I did.
### Part 2:
Effectively used the same approach to part 1 except fixed one of the numbers first to then find the other 2.
